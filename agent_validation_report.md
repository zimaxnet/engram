- Marcus/BAU: SUCCESS (start_bau_flow)

## Agent Assessment
**Elena**: 'Accessing the Golden Thread validation tools was distinct and immediate. The function mapping allows me to confirm system truth without ambiguity.'
**Marcus**: 'The BAU flow triggers are now integrated into my dashboard. I can launch standard procedures directly, which significantly reduces the friction of daily operations.'
