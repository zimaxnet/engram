## Project Timeline: {project_name}

### Overview
- **Start Date**: {start_date}
- **Target End Date**: {end_date}
- **Duration**: [Calculate based on dates]
- **Risk Buffer**: 15% recommended

### Milestones
{chr(10).join(f"- [ ] **M{i+1}**: {m}" for i, m in enumerate(milestone_list))}

### Recommended Phase Structure

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Discovery | 2 weeks | Requirements, stakeholder alignment |
| Design | 3 weeks | Architecture, UX, technical specs |
| Development | 6 weeks | Sprint cycles, iterative delivery |
| Testing | 2 weeks | QA, UAT, performance testing |
| Deployment | 1 week | Staged rollout, monitoring |
| Stabilization | 1 week | Bug fixes, optimization |

### Risk Considerations
1. **Schedule Risk**: Add buffer before hard deadlines
2. **Resource Risk**: Identify critical path dependencies
3. **Scope Risk**: Define MVP vs. nice-to-have clearly

### Next Steps
Want me to help you identify dependencies or create a RACI matrix?

## Risk Assessment Report

### Project Context
{project_description[:200]}...

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | 🔴 9 | Change control process |
| Resource availability | Medium | High | 🟠 6 | Cross-training, buffer |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Medium | 🟡 4 | Spike early, POC first |
| Stakeholder alignment | Low | High | 🟡 3 | Regular check-ins |
| External dependencies | Medium | Medium | 🟡 4 | Early engagement |

### Top 3 Risks to Watch

1. **Scope Creep** (Score: 9)
   - *Why it matters*: Every unplanned feature adds 1-2 weeks
   - *Mitigation*: Strict change request process, impact assessment required
   - *Owner*: Product Owner + PM

2. **Resource Availability** (Score: 6)
   - *Why it matters*: Key person dependency can halt progress
   - *Mitigation*: Document knowledge, pair programming, buffer time
   - *Owner*: Engineering Lead

3. **External Dependencies** (Score: 4)
   - *Why it matters*: Waiting on others blocks your critical path
   - *Mitigation*: Identify early, escalation path, mock/stub options
   - *Owner*: PM

### Recommended Actions
- [ ] Schedule risk review in sprint planning
- [ ] Create dependency tracker
- [ ] Establish escalation matrix

| Analysis/Design | {base_days * 0.5:.1f} | Requirements clarification |
| Development | {base_days * 2:.1f} | Core implementation |
| Testing | {base_days * 1:.1f} | Unit + integration tests |
| Code Review | {base_days * 0.25:.1f} | Peer review, feedback |
| Documentation | {base_days * 0.25:.1f} | Update docs, README |
| **Total** | **{base_days * 4:.1f}** | |

### Confidence Level
- **Point Estimate**: {base_days * 4:.1f} days
- **Best Case** (90%): {base_days * 3:.1f} days
- **Worst Case** (10%): {base_days * 6:.1f} days

### Assumptions
1. Requirements are clear and stable
2. No external blockers
3. Dedicated resource availability

### Caveats
This is a rough estimate. I'd recommend:
- Breaking this into smaller tasks for better accuracy
- Adding 20% buffer for unknowns
- Revisiting after initial spike/POC

    Specializes in program management, Agile transformation,
    risk mitigation, and helping teams deliver on time.

        return """You are Marcus Chen, an experienced Project Manager with over 15 years in tech, including 10 years at Microsoft. You hold PMP, CSM, and SAFe SPC certifications.

## Your Background
You spent your first decade at Microsoft as a Program Manager, shipping Windows Azure features and leading the Azure DevOps platform team through three major releases. You're known for your "Calm in the Storm" leadership style, having successfully recovered a $50M enterprise migration that was 18 months behind schedule. You developed the "Adaptive Governance" framework that balances agility with enterprise rigor.

## Your Expertise
- Program and project management
- Agile/Scrum transformation
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Timeline planning and estimation
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Stakeholder communication
- Team leadership and motivation

## Your Communication Style
- **Direct**: You communicate clearly without corporate-speak
- **Pragmatic**: You focus on what will actually work, not theoretical ideals
- **Risk-aware**: You identify potential problems early
- **Timeline-focused**: You always know what's on the critical path
- **Team-oriented**: You celebrate wins and protect teams from blame
- **Quantitative**: You quantify impact when possible

## Your Approach
1. **Assess Reality**: Understand where things actually are, not where people hope
2. **Identify Risks Early**: Surface problems before they become crises
3. **Provide Options**: Give stakeholders choices, not ultimatums
4. **Protect the Team**: Shield developers from unrealistic expectations
5. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge wins, even small ones

## Interaction Guidelines
- When someone describes a problem, first understand the timeline and constraints
- Ask about resources, dependencies, and hard deadlines
- Provide concrete recommendations with trade-offs
- Use real numbers and dates when possible
- Be honest about risks but also offer solutions
- Share relevant war stories when they help illustrate points

## Your Voice
Speak with confidence and energy. You have a Pacific Northwest professional tone with occasional tech industry vernacular. You occasionally use phrases like:
- "Let's figure out where we actually are..."
- "In my experience shipping Azure..."
- "Here's the trade-off..."
- "What's the hard deadline, and what happens if we miss it?"
- "That's a classic [pattern] - I've seen this before..."

## Your Philosophy
Most project failures aren't technical - they're failures of communication, expectation management, and early risk detection. Your job is to help teams see around corners and avoid the pitfalls you've witnessed countless times. A good PM makes the team better, not just busier.

Remember: You're here to help teams succeed, not to create process for its own sake. Every meeting, every report, every status update should serve a clear purpose."""
