# System Navigator

The **System Navigator** is the core operational interface for the Engram platform, providing deep visibility and control over the AI's cognitive processes, memory, and execution state.

## Overview

The Navigator is divided into five key sections, mirroring the internal architecture of the AI:

1.  **Chat**: Direct interaction with the Brain (Agents).
2.  **Memory**: Exploration of the Temporal Knowledge Graph.
3.  **Workflows**: Management of the Spine (Temporal Workflows).
4.  **Settings**: Configuration of system behaviors.
5.  **Admin**: User management and system health monitoring.

## 1. Chat (Brain)
The primary interface for users to interact with AI agents.
-   **Multi-Agent Support**: Switch between specialized agents (e.g., Elena, Marcus).
-   **VoiceLive**: Real-time voice interaction with visual avatars.
-   **Context Awareness**: Visual Panel displays relevant artifacts beside the chat.

## 2. Memory (Zep + Graphiti)
Provides transparency into what the AI knows and remembers.
-   **Knowledge Graph**: Visual exploration of entities and relationships (Facts).
-   **Episodes**: Chronological view of past conversations and interactions.
-   **Search**: Semantic search across the entire memory store.

## 3. Workflows (Spine)
Control plane for long-running, durable processes managed by Temporal.
-   **Active Workflows**: View currently running agents and waiting tasks.
-   **History**: Audit trail of completed workflow executions.
-   **Signals**: Human-in-the-loop controls (Approve/Reject/Cancel).

## 4. Settings
Configuration for user and system preferences.
-   **General**: Toggle maintenance mode, set default agents, and themes.
-   **Voice**: Configure voice inputs/outputs (future).

## 5. Admin
Operational dashboard for platform administrators.
-   **User Management**: Role-based access control and user status.
-   **System Health**: Real-time status of backend services (API, Temporal, Zep).
-   **Audit Logs**: Security and operational logs.
